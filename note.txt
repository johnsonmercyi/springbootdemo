Beans are java classes annotated with:
@Component:
  @Service
  @Repository
  @Controller

Beans are managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container.

class ThisIsABean {

}

Inside a spring ioc it's save as: thisIsABean

We can create custom beans (set of methods annotated with the @Bean annotation) and manage them in a class annotated with @Configuration (a bean)
